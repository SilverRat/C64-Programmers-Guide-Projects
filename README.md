Code listings from the C64 Programmers Guide

This repository is where I'm keeping the code listings I have typed in from the C64 Programmers Reference Guide

I have uploaded a PDF of the First Edition, Second printing as that is the version I'm working from. I don't know
if later printings/editions may have changed the page numbering, and I use page numbers in the projects to help
identify the location of the code in the Guide.

I have used the CBM prg studio, but you can also use add-ins in VS Code to run these samples among many other options
available to experienced users/programmers.  

Note, this does not use the integrated GIT features in CBM prg studio. I use VS Code for versioning, but command line
GIT would work just as well. This is not an issue if you just want to download and run the code, but may help you 
understand what I've setup if you decide to fork the repository and play with it yourself.
